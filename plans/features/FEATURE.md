# my-money

I want to be able to track all of my income and expenses, assets, savings and investements.

I am not trying to replace Quicken or Quickbooks.

But I want a tool I can use to store personal finances.

Ideally it can integrate into the company's systems I use for banking and investing and any other online tool that can help gather info on those topics.

- I have accounts with M&T Bank where all income and payments go in and out of
- I have investment/401k accounts with:
  - Fidelity Investments
  - iTrust Capital
- I own a home and it has value and a mortgage with Sunwest Mortage
- I have a credit card account to track

Now even if not all these systems can be integrated with, I want to track them all over time.

how much I have vs owe.  total in accounts.  total value.

For investments, I want it to track value of stocks and minerals and crypto.

There are tools for this online but they call cost money and/or off easy integrations but then sell your data or advertise to you.

I want my own tool tracking my own data.

## Scope updates

This section records explicit, owner-approved changes to the domain scope that
CLAUDE.md §Domain Scope marks as requiring an explicit decision before they may
be built. CLAUDE.md points here as the authoritative place for those decisions.

### 2026-06-19 — Spending analytics + simple budgets (in scope)

Source: [IDEAS2.md](IDEAS2.md). The owner explicitly asked to "expand my-money
to provide details on spending and budgets related to categories" and to see
"historical and future trends … as a whole, per category, per account."

- **In scope (newly added):**
  - **Spending analytics** — historical income/expense trends as a whole, per
    category, per group, and per account, over time (first-party SQL only).
  - **Simple monthly per-category budget targets** — a recurring monthly target
    per category with actual-vs-target tracking, plus a deterministic
    trailing-average forecast of future spend.
- **Still explicitly OUT of scope:** envelope / rollover / "assign every dollar"
  (YNAB-style) budgeting; tax forms or capital-gains reporting; anything that
  ships financial data to a third-party (no LLM categorization, no analytics
  SaaS — per CLAUDE.md §Privacy).

Implemented under **ADR-018** (IDEAS.md §11 Decision Log) via [PLAN8.md](PLAN8.md).
